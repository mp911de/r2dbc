= Getting support for R2DBC

== GitHub issues

We choose not to use GitHub issues for general usage questions and support, preferring to use issues solely for the tracking of bugs and enhancements.
If you have a general usage question please do not open a GitHub issue, but use one of the other channels described below.

If you are reporting a bug, please help to speed up problem diagnosis by providing as much information as possible.
Ideally, that would include a small sample project that reproduces the problem.

== Stack Overflow

The R2DBC community monitors the https://stackoverflow.com/tags/r2dbc[`r2dbc`] tag on Stack Overflow.
Before asking a question, please familiarize yourself with Stack Overflow's https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask[advice on how to ask a good question].

== Gitter

If you want to discuss something or have a question that isn't suited to Stack Overflow, the R2DBC community chat in the https://gitter.im/R2DBC/R2DBC[#R2DBC room on Gitter].
